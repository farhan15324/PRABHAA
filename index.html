    <p>Lord Murugan, also known as Kartikeya or Subrahmanya, is the Hindu god of war, wisdom, and victory. He is the son of Shiva and Parvati and the younger brother of Ganesha. Depicted as a youthful warrior with a spear (Vel) and a peacock mount, Murugan symbolizes courage and spiritual insight.  
        
        He is especially revered in Tamil culture and has six key temples in Tamil Nadu, known as the **Aarupadai Veedu**. These temples commemorate his life events, such as defeating the demon Surapadman and teaching divine wisdom. Major festivals like **Thaipusam** and **Skanda Shashti** celebrate his deeds and attract devotees.  
        
        Murugan represents the triumph of good over evil and guides devotees toward enlightenment and victory in life.</p>
